-- | The classifier portion of a wain's brain is a Self-Organising Map
--   (SOM). This SOM uses a hexagonal grid with hexagonal tiles. The

--   As the population increases toward this limit, the metabolism
--   cost increases, ensuring that only the fittest individuals
--   survive.

--   a bit higher than your desired maximum population.

-- *** Controlling the frequency of flirting

-- Every time an agent flirts, its energy changes by a fixed amount.
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.

-- Also see passionDelta

-- Note: Passion is reset to zero after mating.

-- *** Controlling the frequency of mating

-- Every time an agent mates, its energy changes by a fixed amount.
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.

-- If an agent is raising a child, then every time the parent gets a CPU
-- turn, its energy changes.
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.

-- Note: Passion is reset to zero after mating.

-- Every time an agent gets a CPU turn, its passion changes by a fixed
-- amount.
-- This is normally a passion GAIN, so it should be positive.
passionDelta :: Double

-- *** Controlling the size of the classifier

-- Every time an agent gets a CPU turn, its energy changes based on how
-- many classifier models it has.
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.
energyDeltaPerClassifierModel :: Double

-- Every time an agent gets a CPU turn, its energy changes by an amount
-- based on normalised chi-squared (to discourage wasted categories)

-- *** Controlling the frequency of co-operation

-- When an agent initiates co-operation (trading classifications), its
-- energy changes by a fixed amount.
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.
cooperationEnergyDelta :: Double

-- When two agents co-operate, and agree on a classification, their
