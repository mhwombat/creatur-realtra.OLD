-- | The classifier portion of a wain's brain is a Self-Organising Map

-- *** Controlling the frequency of flirting

-- Every time an agent flirts, its energy changes by a fixed amount.
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.
flirtingEnergyDelta :: Double
flirtingEnergyDelta = -0.01

-- Also see passionDelta

-- Note: Passion is reset to zero after mating.

-- *** Controlling the frequency of mating

-- Every time an agent mates, its energy changes by a fixed amount.
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.

-- If an agent is raising a child, then every time the parent gets a CPU
-- turn, its energy changes.
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.

-- Note: Passion is reset to zero after mating.

-- -- Every time an agent gets a CPU turn, its passion changes by a fixed

-- passionDelta = 0.1

-- *** Controlling an agent's CPU usage

-- Every time an agent gets a CPU turn, its energy changes based on how
-- its size.
-- Most of an agent's size is taken up by its brain, so the agent's size
-- can be used as a proxy for its CPU usage.
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.
energyDeltaPerByte :: Double
energyDeltaPerByte = -0.000001

-- Every time an agent gets a CPU turn, its energy changes by an amount
-- based on normalised chi-squared (to discourage wasted categories)
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.

-- See also cooperationAgreementDelta

-- *** Controlling the frequency of co-operation

-- When an agent initiates co-operation (trading classifications), its
-- energy changes by a fixed amount.
-- This is normally an energy LOSS, so it should be negative.
cooperationEnergyDelta :: Double
cooperationEnergyDelta = -0.01

-- When two agents co-operate, and agree on a classification, their
-- energy changes by a fixed amount.
-- This is normally an energy GAIN, so it should be positive.
